# voice-recorder-android

A dictaphone app where users can record and log short voice messages. The app keeps history of the
recordings so users can play them later.

# Scope

- The app is all local, no need for authentication or storing anything in the cloud
- Limit recordings to 60 seconds so you donâ€™t need to deal with large files
- Recordings play continuously: when a user plays a recording, it will automatically play the
  following recordings in order
- No need for a nice UI. Focus rather on robust functionality/usability for a small-scale production
  app - No need for tests in the code
- You can program in the language, framework you prefer and use any libraries

# Android, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose App, MVVM

Example of a single-screen app created from the standard Android Studio Template (Empty Activity).
This project demonstrates Compose UI alongside the separation of code into a View, ViewModel, and
Repository.
